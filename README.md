# Hi, I'm Gabriel:
I'm a software engineering student, currently enrolled at PUC Minas. I'm a lifelong learner, passionate about Jiu Jitsu, literature, mathematics, and, of course, programming. At the moment, I am currently learning more about DevOps, Cloud, and cybersecurity, but studying is my passion, so I'm always eager to dive into new challenges, expand my knowledge, and keep evolving every day.

Check out some of my tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/@gnvr-zb7tw)
